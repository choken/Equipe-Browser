== Welcome to Equipe Browser

This is an implementation of a simple website that browses Equipe.com's REST API.
It uses the ruby on rails curl plugin called Patron to make background calls to 
the API and the present the data html coded. 

As the name implies, it's a browser.

The project was started as a simple assignment to Equipe.com.


Do not forget to call the following commands before starting the webserver.
rake db:create
rake db:migrate

At the moment it is just a dummy database, but it might be populated later on.
